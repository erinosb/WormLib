# WormLib
Modular image analysis toolkit to quantify Caenorhabditis elegans microscopy images. This toolkit can be used for smFISH spot detection (mRNA), fluorescence markers (proteins), colocalization (both), and other appliations. It allows for segmenting C. elegans embryos into individual blastomeres in early stages.
